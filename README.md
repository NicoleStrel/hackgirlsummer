## Challenges we ran into
ouch lots of  challenges

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
* Utilizing the knowledge we gained from the workshops to create our application
* Being able to work together and produce something despite our major time zone differences and limited time.
* Being able to bring all of our unique educational backgrounds to produce a product.
* Learning that this is a novel idea that others have not created before.

## What we learned

We learned how to use Flutter for the first time, and how to work together with different skill sets. In addition, we learned that many tools and libraries like |blah,blah,blah| exist that can be used to make our app a reality.

## What's next for Have Her Back

In the future, we are hoping to implement more tools to foster a sense of unity and empowerement. For example, we may include channels were users can discuss day-to-day events and provide each other with resources. We may also insert a channel that allows users to report sexual harassment and other major issues women deal with. Each time a women reports an event a marker is added to the location where the event occurred. The marker can have different colors to signify different issues.
